/**
 * Series labels are placed as close to the series as possible in a
 * natural way, seeking to avoid other series. The goal of this
 * feature is to make the chart more easily readable, like if a
 * human designer placed the labels in the optimal position.
 *
 * The series labels currently work with series types having a
 * `graph` or an `area`.
